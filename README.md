# Browser Extension Development Template
# Motivation
I tried to develop a browser extension without any CLI tools in the past and I found the development experience to be not good. As a web developer, I used to create projects using tools like `vite` or `modern.js`. These tools spared me the need to handle configurations such as `ts`, `eslint`, and `webpack`. Instead, I could focus directly on implementing functionalities. Recently, I stumbled upon `TKScript` and was impressed by its high level of engineering. This inspired me to create this project template based on it.
# Usage
```bash
pnpm i

```
